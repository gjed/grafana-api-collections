  After you've created the pull request:
  
  - If the maintainer askds for any changes, edit your changes, push, and ask for another review.
  - If the maintainer decides to pass on your pull request, they will thank you for the contribution and explain why they won't be accepting the changes

## Set up the project

  > It is strongly recommended to use VSCode for this project

  To setup the project:

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Install the suggested VSCode extensions (Thunder Client and REST Client)
  3. Check that the workspace configuration is set up correctly:
      - The Thunder-client extensions uses this vscode setting to know where the collection is located `"thunder-client.customLocation"`. Modify the `.vscode/settings.json` and specify the correct path. Please refer to the [original documentation](https://github.com/rangav/thunder-client-support#team)

## Export to postman format

The Thunder Client extension allows you to export the collection in postman format. This will export the collection to postman v1 format. If you need to export to postman v2 format, check the [official documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#converting-postman-collections-from-v1-to-v2) on how you can migrate from v1 to v2.
